# Notes   

* Same as list comprehension, except put in parenthesis instead of brackets
  * This creates a generator, which is an iterable and you can treat like most other iterables
* This doesn't store the result in memory, but rather stores an iterable. This is less resource-intensive since it doesn't store a huge object in memory 
* This is how you create a generator function 

```
def num_sequence(n):
"""Generate values from 0 to n."""
  i = 0
  while i < n:
    yield i
    i += 1
